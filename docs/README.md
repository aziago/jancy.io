## Every Tab is a New Session
Each Jancy browser tab is a brand new session that's never been anywhere on the Internet. Tabs do not share any session or cookie information with other tabs unless instructed to do so. Tabs don't save session data to disk either.  When a tab goes away all it's information is gone with it.
